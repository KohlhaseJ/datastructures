# Advanced Data Structures

## Description

Implementations for data structures and corresponding algorithms towards different problems like querying for the closest point or resolving collisions in hasing tables. This collection originated through the course of a university lecture.

## Data Structures

### Bisector Tree
The bisector tree is a data structure towards the closest point problem proposed in [1]. An implementation is available here `src/BisectorTree.c`.

### Linear Probing
Linear probing is a scheme to resolve collsions in hashing tables. The source code is available here `src/LinearProbing.c` and holds an implementation of both Robin Hood [2] and LCFS [3] linear probing.

### Van Emde Boas Tree
The Van Emde Boas tree [4] is a data structure towards the implementation of priority queues. An implemnetation can be found at `src/VanEmdeBoas.c`.

## Run program

In order to run experiments with the provided data structures, one first need to compile the C code using a compiler (e.g. `gcc`).

For example:

```sh
cd src

# compile code
gcc -o BisectorTree BisectorTree.c

# run compiled code
./BisectorTree
```
